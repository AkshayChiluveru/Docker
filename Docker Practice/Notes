Containers are the fundamental building block of the Docker toolkit and that's one of the first things.

how to start containers:
how to manage different aspects of a container: start it, stop it, delete it, create it...

And we're going to use Nginx for all that. Nginx is a really basic web server that is going to be easy for us to use just to learn the Docker commands and how to do Docker container stuff.

Command: docker version
    verified cli can talk to engine

command: docker info
    most config values of engine
docker command line structure
    old(still works): docker <command> (options)
    new: docker <command> <sub command> (options)
    

Image vs container

    - An Image is the application we want to run
    - A Container is an instanve of that image running as a process
    - You can have many containers running off the same image
    - Our Image will be the Nginx web server
    - Docker's default image 'registry' is called Docker hub (hub.docker.com)
